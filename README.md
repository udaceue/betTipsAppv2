# betTipsAppReshape

# That's the only one project worth to recruiters attention. Currently I'm stopped front-end coding cause of learning backend in node/express/mariadb to finish entire project by myself.

Newest version of project is located in main branch. I lost my entire progress on local and remote repo cause of mistake. To run project you need to install all dependencies in package.json

Project at this moment has only 5sections/routes "HOME", "BetTips", "Tools", "Login", "SignUp" available from menu bar located at the top of the app. Currently I'm gonna learn some backend to finish project by myself.

I dont have access to pay versions sports api so I downloaded single request by postman from sofascore api to simulate how can it works. Feel free to use it if you also interested in sports betting Hope you enjoyed my idea!
